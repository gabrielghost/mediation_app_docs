# Project Mediation App

This project is based on a need for streamlining the divorce or separation process. This is the development diary of the process.

## Day 1 - 5th February 2018

To recap what I've worked on up until this point - On Saturday I was working through a logo idea - we have two names in contention - 1. SplitPea and 2. MediateMe. 1 has a more aesthetic concept, and 2 has more of a ring to it.

On satruday I roughly sketched out the splash page for the application, initially as SplitPea. Yesterday I thought that perhaps it might work well by using the same aesthetic as SplitPea, but instead of 'peas' there are still emojis, they are just blue instead. Below are the two options:

![MediateMe](./assets/mediate-me-logo.png)

I'm torn! I like the green, but I like the ring of the MediateMe too. Both circular critters are cute and I think give the brand a more playful child-like edge which is essentially the purpose of this project - to keep the children in mind.

The two splash pages are as follows:

### Today's Objective

Now there's a basic aesthetic going, whichever one is chosen, I think clarity on the user journey as far as wireframes is the best place to start. At the moment they might not look like much - just text on a page, but the entirety of the app should be plotted out. Once this is done, and know how each page feeds into the other, we can start to fill each page in with designs and see how the flow works on a deeper level. This may take a few days to work though, but this is today's aim. I'll plot this out visually using sketch, so that if I get taken by a particular passage of thinking, it won't take too much to fill it out with more details.

If I get bored of the process thinking, I might design some little blue critters this evening.

#### The thinking

So I think I'll start with the mediator wireframes, simply because without the mediator, at least initially, there will be no partners, and that's how they will be invited into the system. For this we need:

- Mediator login page
- Case CRUD
- User CRUD

So I've worked through the login pages, and the case indexes. See below.

I'm now thinking about how best to display the case data to the mediator.
